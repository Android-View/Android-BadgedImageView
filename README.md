# Android BadgedImageView

![Screenshot](preview.png)

Easily add badges to an `ImageView` to describe its content.

Recently, in [Talon for Twitter](https://github.com/klinker24/Talon-for-Twitter), one of my challenges was that you couldn't tell if media was a GIF, video, YouTube, etc. All the images just had the generic play button on them. This library, based off of [Plaid](https://github.com/nickbutcher/plaid), was my way to fix that.

Google+ uses a very similar style in their own app.

## Features

Place a badge over the top of the `ImageView` to describe its content.

 - Use any text you like
 - Change the badge color
 - Change the placement of the badge using `Gravity`
 - Change the padding on the badge

## Installation

There are two ways to use this library:

#### As a Gradle dependency

This is the preferred way. Simply add:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.klinkerapps:badged_imageview:1.0.5'
}
```

to your project dependencies and run `./gradlew build` or `./gradlew assemble`.

#### As a library project

Download the source code and import it as a library project in Eclipse. The project is available in the folder **library**. For more information on how to do this, read [here](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects).

## Example Usage

Functionality can be found in the example's [MainActivity](https://github.com/klinker24/Android-BadgedImageView/blob/master/example/src/main/java/com/klinker/android/badged_imageview_example/MainActivity.java). Badges on `BadgedImageView` can be added (or changed) from code:

```java
badgedIv.setBadge("YouTube", Color.RED);
badgedIv.setBadge("GIF"); // default badge color is white
```

or they can be defined in XML layout:
```xml
<com.klinker.android.badged_imageview.BadgedImageView
    android:id="@+id/badged_iv"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="200dp"
    android:src="@drawable/gif"
    android:layout_margin="12dp"
    android:scaleType="centerCrop"
    app:badgeGravity="start|bottom"
    app:badgePadding="12dp"
    app:badgeColor="@android:color/white"
    app:badgeText="GIF" />
```
